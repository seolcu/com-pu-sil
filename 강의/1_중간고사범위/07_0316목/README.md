Attempt the following exercises and show the solutions to the TA.

Note: Using the Internet, and/or using an IDE to edit your code is not allowed.

1. Use the conversion characters and printf() to print the following outputs to the monitor:  
   A) 20A3.1  
   B) 20 A 3.1 (note the width specification here)  
   C) 32.6 (Note the width=10 and the precision=3 specifications here, the answer should be in the aaaaaa.aaa format.  
   D) 00255.15

2. Use scanf to input the following data, and print back each to the user.  
   A) 100 300 35B  
   B) 010-6842-9282

3. Display the decimal version of each of the following characters:  
   A a B b C c

4. Accept two random numbers a and b from the user, and use:  
   A) Nested-if statement to print if the numbers are equal, a is greater than b, or b is greater than a.  
   B) Do A without using a nested if statement

5. Use the switch construct to write a program that mimics a simple calculator. Accept the inputs a and b from the user. Also accept the type of operation to perform (+, -, \*, /). Display the computed result using printf().
