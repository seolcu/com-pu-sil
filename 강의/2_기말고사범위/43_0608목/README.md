Posted on: Thursday, June 8, 2023 2:00:00 PM KST

## Instruction

1. The assignment is individual work. Please attempt all the tasks by yourself. Plagiarism may be checked. If you ever want any help, it is possible to ask your coding trainer or the TA.

2. Submit your solutions/codes to Ajou BB. Include your name and student id when zipping the final submission. Please submit text files only!

3. Using the internet and/or an IDE is not allowed! You may get a deduction for violation.

## Questions on Binary Files:

Combine-in-order the contents of two binary files and create an output file. Assume the two binary files contain real numbers. The third binary file, however, will contain the ordered series of the real numbers.

For example,

If binary file A contains the following data:

> 34,25,3,4, etc.

and binary file B contains the data:

> 100,3,24,6, etc.

The output file will contain the ordered series of the numbers:

> 3,4,6,24,25,34,100, etc.

Assumption:

- File sizes are the same.

Requirements:

- Files must be binary.
- An array should not be declared in the program.
- Test your program with random numbers.

Total grading point is 100.

| Question 1                                                                                                        | Total: 100 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| The file handling is done correctly, opening, reading, writing and closing binary files.                          | 20         |
| The sorting logic is given to sort the numbers in ascending order and are stored in new file with desired output. | 40         |
| End of the file handling is done appropriately.                                                                   | 10         |
| Logic to hand any for error handling of the file.                                                                 | 10         |
| Proper input validation is provided to ensure the input binary files have the same size.                          | 10         |
| No use of array in the program                                                                                    | 10         |

Note: These are the outlines for grading your code, but as logic of the programming varies, so it will be scored accordingly. Feel free to email or visit TA for any queries.
