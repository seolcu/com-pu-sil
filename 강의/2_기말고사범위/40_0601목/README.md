Posted on: Thursday, June 1, 2023 2:00:00 PM KST

## Instruction

1. The assignment is individual work. Please attempt all the tasks by yourself. Plagiarism may be checked. If you ever want any help, it is possible to ask your coding trainer or the TA.

2. Submit your solutions/codes to Ajou BB. Include your name and student id when zipping the final submission. Please submit text files only!

3. Using the internet and/or an IDE is not allowed! You may get a deduction for violation.

## Questions on Structures:

For these exercises, using functions from the “string.h” is not allowed.

1. Accept a series of integer numbers from the user, at least 20 in number. Then, create two files named prime.txt and composite.txt. Write all prime numbers to prime.txt; and write composite numbers to composite.txt.

Your code should have a mechanism to handle any file error that may occur.

2. In the previous assignments, we read a series of inputs from the command line to an array of complex numbers. Now, write that array to a file named complex.txt. Write each complex number to the file line by line.

{(2,3),(4,4),(5,6),(9,4)}// arrayofStructures (Complex numbers)

Final contents of complex.txt

2+3i

4+4i

5+6i

9+4i

Total grading point is 100.

| At least 20 numbers are accepted from the user.                                                                                                 | 10        |
| The code is able to identify prime and composite numbers                                                                                        | 20        |
| The code can create prime.txt and composite.txt and the prime numbers are stored in prime.txt and composite numbers are stored in composite.txt | 20        |
| The code is able to handle file errors appropriately, eg when file creation or opening fails                                                    | 10        |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| The main function and the function to write complex numbers to file are separately implemented.  | 10       |
| The array of structures is used to represent the complex numbers                                 | 5        |
| The function to write the complex numbers line by line in the file "Complex.txt" is implemented. | 20       |
| The string.h library is not used                                                                 | 5        |

Note: These are the outlines for grading your code, but as logic of the programming varies, so it will be scored accordingly. Feel free to email or visit TA for any queries.
