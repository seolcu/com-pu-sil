## Questions

### 1. Work with multidimensional arrays:

Write a C program that gives the result of the multiplication of two user-given matrices:
First, receive dimension information of both matrices from the user.
Check whether multiplication can proceed and inform the user.
Perform multiplication and display the result to the user.

Example:

### 2. Dividing a program into modules and understanding techniques for collaboration:

Revise your previous calculator program: define four functions, separate ones for
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each function should be implemented
in a separate “_.c” file. Hence, you should have four “_.c” files. Write a header “\*.h” file
that declares the prototypes of all the functions and run the program to confirm the same
effect.
