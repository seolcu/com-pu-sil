## Questions

### Work with Pointers

1. Write a function named “search” that will check for the existence of at least one element in an
   integer array. If the element we look for exists, return the address of the element, and access
   the actual element inside the main function. If the element is not found, return a null address.

2. Revise the above function so that the addresses of the largest and smallest elements can be
   returned to the main function, and actual values of the largest and smallest elements are
   printed inside the main function.

3. Write an “accumulator” function that will sum up all the elements of an array and return the
   result to the main function. For addition, individual elements of the array should be accessed
   using only pointers.
